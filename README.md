🚖 Project Description – Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning 🤖📊

In the modern world, predictive analytics has become an essential tool 🔑 for businesses to make smarter decisions. As part of my CodeTech internship, I worked on Task 2, where the goal was to build a machine learning model to predict 🚕 taxi fare amounts based on trip details.

The dataset used for this project was the NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Records (January 2024 sample) 📂. It included important information such as 👥 passenger count, 📏 trip distance, 🕒 pickup time, ⏱ trip duration, and 💵 fare amount. These features make the dataset realistic and suitable for predictive analysis.

🟢 Step 1: Data Preprocessing

I started by cleaning the data 🧹, removing missing values, and ensuring the correct format for dates and numbers. I then performed feature engineering by creating new columns such as trip duration (in minutes) and pickup hour. These features helped the model better capture real-world travel behavior ⏳🚌.

🟢 Step 2: Model Training

I selected Linear Regression 📐 from the scikit-learn library because it is simple, interpretable, and effective for regression problems. The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate performance fairly.

🟢 Step 3: Evaluation

After training, the model’s predictions were compared against actual fare values ✅. I used metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score to measure accuracy. The results showed that trip distance and trip duration were the strongest predictors of taxi fare amounts.

🟢 Step 4: Visualization

To make the findings clear 📊, I created plots such as:

📈 Actual vs Predicted Fares → showing a strong positive correlation.

🕒 Trips by Pickup Hour → highlighting busy times of the day.

💳 Payment Method Patterns (from Task 1 insights).

🟢 Conclusion

This project demonstrated how machine learning can be applied to real-world datasets to predict outcomes 🔮. By combining data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and visualization, I gained strong practical skills in predictive analysis. This task also proved how taxi operators can use ML to optimize pricing, manage fleets efficiently 🚖⚡, and improve customer experience 😊
